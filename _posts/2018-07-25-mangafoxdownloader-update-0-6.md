I replaced all links with old mangafox url with the current url, and  i added a param ``l:`` to set manually it. The GUI is working again with a new procedure to get the cover (now its stored in the .cache folder).   

In command line you can now omit the path ``p:`` param and the manga will be downloaded in the program folder.  

You can download the version 1.6 in the [program page]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}p/mangafoxdownloader).
